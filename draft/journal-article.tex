\section{Introduction}
Eigenvalue problems play a fundamental role in engineering. In particular, in structural mechanics, the discretisation and solution of eigenvalue problems are at the heart of \textit{modal analysis}, i.e. the characterization of the response of an elastic body in terms of its natural modes of vibration.
Let us consider a body occupying a simply connected polygonal domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, with linearly elastic Cauchy stress tensor, i.e $\sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot \vec{u})\mathbb{I}+2\mu\varepsilon(\vec{u})$, where $\vec{u}:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^d$ reppresents the displacement of the elastic body and $\varepsilon(\vec{u})$ is the symmetric gradient of $\vec{u}$.
Under these hypotheses, the balance law for the linear momentum can be expressed in weak form as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:elasticityPrimalSource}
  2\mu \int_{\Omega} \varepsilon(\vec{u}):\varepsilon(\vec{v})\, d\vec{x} + \lambda \int_{\Omega} (\nabla \cdot \vec{u})(\nabla\cdot \vec{v})\, d\vec{x} = \int_{\Omega}\vec{f}\cdot \vec{v} \,d\vec{x} \qquad \forall \vec{v}\in \vec{V},
\end{equation}
where $\vec{f}:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^d$ is the bulk force actioning on the body and $\vec{V}$ is usual Sobolev space $\vec{H}^1_0(\Omega)$. The \textit{modal analysis} corresponding to the previous source problem can be formulated as the following eigenvalue problem:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:elasticityPrimalEig}
  2\mu \int_{\Omega} \varepsilon(\vec{u}):\varepsilon(\vec{v})\, d\vec{x} + \lambda \int_{\Omega} (\nabla \cdot \vec{u})(\nabla\cdot \vec{v})\, d\vec{x} = \omega \int_{\Omega}\vec{u}\cdot \vec{v} \,d\vec{x} \qquad \forall \vec{v} \in \vec{V}.
\end{equation}
Introducing the mechanical pressure $p:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ defined as the trace of the stress tensor, i.e. $p = 2(\lambda+\mu) \nabla\cdot \vec{u}$, the previous eigenvalue problem can be recast as the following eigenvalue problem:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:elasticityPressureEig}
    2\mu \int_\Omega \widehat\varepsilon(\vec{u}):\widehat \varepsilon(\vec{v})\, d\vec{x}+\int_\Omega p (\nabla \cdot \vec{v})\, d\vec{x} = \omega \int_\Omega \vec{u}\cdot \vec{v}\, d\vec{x} \qquad \vec{v}\in \vec{V},
\end{equation}
where $\widehat\varepsilon(\vec{u}) = \varepsilon(\vec{u})-\frac{1}{d}(\nabla\cdot \vec{u})\mathbb{I}$ is the deviatoric part of the symmetric gradient of $\vec{u}$.

It is a well-known fact that for nearly incompressible elasticity, i.e. $\lambda\to \infty$, finite element simulation can experience a degraded order of convergence or even converge to the wrong solution \cite{AinsworthParker}. Such phenomena are broadly referred to as \textbf{locking}. Over the years many different approaches have been proposed to overcome locking.
For instance, the use of high-order finite elements or of specific mesh topology is known to mitigate or even cure in certain cases the locking phenomenon, see \cite{AinsworthParker, BabuskaSuri, BBF} and reference therein.

Another widely adopted approach is to introduce a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the divergence-free condition, which is equivalent to adding to \eqref{eq:elasticityPrimalEig} the constraint
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lagrangeMultiplier}
  \int_\Omega (\nabla\cdot \vec{u})q = 0 \qquad \forall  q\in Q, \text{ with } Q=L^2(\Omega).
\end{equation}
Hence, in the limit $\lambda\to \infty $ the eigenvalue problem \eqref{eq:elasticityPressureEig} becomes the Stokes eigenvalue problem:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:stokes}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\mu \int_\Omega \varepsilon(\vec{u}):\varepsilon(\vec{v})\, d\vec{x}-\int_\Omega \nabla p \cdot \vec{v}\, d\vec{x} &= \omega \int_\Omega \vec{u}\cdot \vec{v}\, d\vec{x} \qquad &\vec{v}\in \vec{V},\\
    -\int_\Omega (\nabla\cdot \vec{u})q &= 0 \qquad&q \in Q,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the pressure $p$ has now the meaning of being a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the divergence-free condition, rather than the mechanical pressure.
When considering the previous eigenvalue problem one can overcome the locking phenomenon if two conditions known as strong and weak approximability conditions are verified, a brief overview of such conditions can be found in section 2 and full detail can be found in \cite{BBG, BBF}.

In this paper, we investigate certain sufficient conditions that guarantee the well-posedness and optimal convergence rate of the mixed finite element method for the class of eigenvalue problems of the type of \eqref{eq:stokes}, also known as $(f\!-\!0)$ eigenvalue problems.
In particular, we aim to discuss two general criteria that guarantee the strong approximability condition that in the author's opinion are easier to verify than the strong approximability condition itself.
The first criterion is based on the inf-sup condition, which is the well-known necessary and sufficient condition for the well-posedness of the Stokes source problem and is also known to be a sufficient condition for the strong approximability condition, see \cite{BBF,BBG}.
The second criterion is the exactness and boundedness of the right inverse of the discrete curl operator. To the best of the author's knowledge, this criterion has never been discussed as a sufficient condition for the strong approximability condition for the Stokes eigenvalue problem.

To achieve this goal in section 2 we briefly recall the Boffi-Brezzi-Gastaldi (BBG) theory of the well-posedness of the mixed finite element method for $(f\!-\!0)$ eigenvalue problems and quickly review estimates for the order of convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
In section 3 we present our main results, i.e.~we investigate the scenario in which the inf-sup condition is not satisfied and we discuss how the strong approximability condition can be a consequence of the exactness and boundedness of the right inverse of the discrete curl operator or of the inf-sup condition on an auxiliary pressure space.
In section 4 we recast the result of section 3 in terms of finite element exterior calculus and comment on the role that the approximation of the divergence-free condition plays in the convergence of the discrete eigenvalue problem.
Lastly, in section 5 we present numerical results that confirm the theoretical findings of the previous sections.
The numerical examples presented include the use of $\mathbb{P}_1-\mathbb{P}_1$ elements on Powell-Sabin split meshes, $\mathbb{P}_2-\mathbb{P}_2$ elements on Alfeld split meshes and $\mathbb{P}_3-\mathbb{P}_2^{\,disc}$ elements on criss-cross split meshes for the Stokes eigenvalue problem in two dimensions.
We will also present in this section a new family of elements of the Bercovier--Pironneau type on Powll-Sabin and Alfeld splits and show that the rate of convergence for this family of elements fits the analysis presented in section 3.
The numerical example will also show that the rate of convergence of the eigenvalues is independent of any geometrical parameter of the mesh singularity, contrary to what is observed for the source problem.

\section{The necessary and sufficient for $(f\!-\!0)$ eigenvalue problems}
Since \cite{BBG} it has been long known that the well-posedness of finite element methods for mixed eigenvalue problems is different from the well-posedness of the source problem.
In fact, while the inf-sup condition is the necessary and sufficient condition for the well-posedness of the source problem, in the context of eigenvalue problems it is neither necessary nor sufficient.
In \cite{BBG} the authors showed that the inf-sup condition is a sufficient condition for the well-posedness of $(f-0)$ eigenvalue problems, but it is not necessary.
In this section, we will briefly recall the main results presented in \cite{BBG}.
To achieve this objective we will first introduce the bilinear forms:
\begin{align}
  a: \vec{V}\times \vec{V}\to \mathbb{R}, \qquad a(\vec{u},\vec{v})\coloneqq\int_{\Omega}\varepsilon(\vec{u}):\varepsilon(\vec{v})\, d\vec{x},\label{eq:a}\\
  b: \vec{V}\times Q\to \mathbb{R}, \qquad b(\vec{u},q)\coloneqq\int_{\Omega} (\nabla\cdot \vec{u})q\, d\vec{x},\label{eq:b}.
\end{align}
Using the bilinear forms defined above we can rewrite the eigenvalue problem \eqref{eq:stokes} as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\mu\, a(\vec{u},\vec{v}) + b(\vec{v},p)&=\omega\, (\vec{u},\vec{v})_{L^2(\Omega)} \qquad &\forall \vec{v}\in \vec{V},\\
    -b(\vec{u},q)&=0 \qquad &\forall q\in Q.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We can also write in a compact form the source problem corresponding to \eqref{eq:stokes}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sourceStokes}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\mu\, a(\vec{u},\vec{v}) + b(\vec{v},p)&=(\vec{f},\vec{v})_{L^2(\Omega)} \qquad &\forall \vec{v}\in \vec{V},\\
    -b(\vec{u},q)&=0 \qquad &\forall q\in Q.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Since the \eqref{eq:sourceStokes} is well-posed at a continuous level, we can define the solution operator $S:\vec{V}\to \vec{V}\times Q$ as the operator that maps $\vec{f}\in \vec{V}$ to the solution of \eqref{eq:sourceStokes} when $\vec{f}$ is the right-hand side.
We will now focus our attention on the well-posedness of conforming mixed finite element methods for the eigenvalue problem \eqref{eq:stokes}, i.e. we fix two finite-dimensional subspaces $\vec{V}_h\subset \vec{V}$ and $Q_h\subset Q$ and we consider the following discrete eigenvalue problem:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:discreteStokes}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\mu\, a(\vec{u}_h,\vec{v}_h) + b(\vec{v}_h,p_h)&=\omega\, (\vec{u}_h,\vec{v}_h)_{L^2(\Omega)} \qquad &\forall \vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h,\\
    -b(\vec{u}_h,q_h)&=0 \qquad &\forall q_h\in Q_h.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and its corresponding source problem:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:discreteSourceStokes}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\mu\, a(\vec{u}_h,\vec{v}_h) + b(\vec{v}_h,p_h)&=(\vec{f}_h,\vec{v}_h)_{L^2(\Omega)} \qquad &\forall \vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h,\\
    -b(\vec{u}_h,q_h)&=0 \qquad &\forall q_h\in Q_h.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We would like to define a discrete counterpart of the solution operator $S$, yet as we know from \cite{Brezzi} such an operator does not exist unless the inf-sup condition is satisfied.
To overcome this issue, we introduce the following proposition:
\begin{proposition}[Proposition 6.5.2 \cite{BBF}]
  Since the bilinear form $a:\vec{V}_h\times \vec{V}_h\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and coercive on the kernel of the discrete divergence operator, i.e.~$\exists \alpha>0$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    a(\vec{v}_h,\vec{v}_h)\geq \alpha\, \norm{\vec{v}_h}^2_{\vec{V}} \qquad \forall \vec{v}_h\in \vec{K}_h\coloneqq \left\{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h\,|\, b(\vec{v}_h,q_h)=0\, \forall q_h\in Q_h\right\},
  \end{equation}
  then \eqref{eq:discreteSourceStokes} has at least one solution of the form $(\vec{u}_h,p_h)\in \vec{V}_h\times Q_h$. Furthermore, the $\vec{u}_h$ component of the solution is uniquely determined by the right-hand side $\vec{f}$ and the following estimate holds:
  \begin{equation}
    \norm{\vec{u}_h}_{\vec{V}}\leq \frac{1}{\alpha}\norm{\vec{f}_h}_{\vec{V}^\prime}.
  \end{equation}
  Hence, we can define the discrete solution operator $S_h:\vec{V}_h\to \vec{V}_h\times Q_h$ as the operator that maps $\vec{f}\in \vec{V}_h$ to a solution of \eqref{eq:discreteSourceStokes} when $\vec{f}$ is the right-hand side, suppose the one with the smallest norm.
\end{proposition}
Clearly, the existence of multiple discrete solutions when lacking the inf-sup condition forces us to consider a different approach to the well-posedness of the discrete eigenvalue problem, than just asking for $\norm{S-S_h}_{\mathcal{L}(\vec{V},\vec{V})}\to 0$ as $h\to 0$.
For this reason we we consider the following ``prolongation'' operators and the ``restriction'' operators defined as their adjoints:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \pi_{\vec{V}}&:\vec{V}^\prime \to \vec{V}^\prime\times Q^\prime, \qquad &\vec{f}\mapsto (\vec{f},0),  \qquad\qquad \pi_{\vec{V}}^\ast&:\vec{V}\times Q \to \vec{V}, \qquad &(\vec{f},0) \mapsto \vec{f}\\ 
    \pi_{Q}&:Q^\prime \to \vec{V}^\prime\times Q^\prime, \qquad &g\mapsto (0,g),  \qquad\qquad \pi_{Q}^\ast&:\vec{V}\times Q \to Q, \qquad &(0,g) \mapsto g.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We now consider the restriction of the continuous and discrete solution operators defined as
\begin{equation}
  T\coloneqq \pi_{\vec{V}}^\ast\circ S\circ \pi_{\vec{V}}:\vec{H}\to \vec{H} \qquad \qquad \qquad T_h\coloneqq \pi_{\vec{V}}^\ast\circ S_h\circ \pi_{\vec{V}}:\vec{H} \to \vec{H}, 
\end{equation}
where $\vec{H}$ is the $\vec{L}^2(\Omega)$ space and we have identified $\vec{L}^2(\Omega)$ with its dual space and made used of the inclusion $\vec{V}\subset \vec{H}$ and $\vec{H}\subset \vec{V}^\prime$, hence we are not allowed any more Riesz identifications.
Notice now that from the previous proposition, we have that $T$ and $T_h$ are well-posed and uniquely defined, so the only thing left to do is to discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions so that $\norm{T-T_h}_{\mathcal{L}(\vec{H},\vec{H})}\to 0$ as $h\to 0$.
To achieve this goal we introduce two subspaces of $\vec{V}$ and $Q$ endowed with their natural norms, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vec{V}_0 &= \pi_{\vec{V}}^\ast\circ S\circ \pi_{\vec{V}}\left(\vec{L}^2(\Omega)\right), \qquad \norm{\vec{u}}_{\vec{V}_0} = \underset{\vec{f}\in\, T^{-1}\vec{v}}{\inf}\norm{\vec{f}}_{\vec{L}^2(\Omega)},\\
    Q_0 &= \pi_{Q}^\ast\circ S\circ \pi_{Q}\left(\vec{L}^2(\Omega)\right), \qquad \norm{q}_{\vec{Q}_0} = \underset{\vec{f}\in\, (\pi_Q^\ast \circ S \circ \pi_{\vec{V}})^{-1}\vec{v}}{\inf}\norm{\vec{f}}_{\vec{L}^2(\Omega)}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{definition}
  We say the pair $(Q_h,Q_0)$ satisfies the weak approximability condition if there exists a constant $C>0$ and an exponent $\gamma_1>0$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \underset{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{K}_h}{\sup} \frac{b(\vec{v}_h,q)}{\norm{\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}} \leq C h^{\gamma_1}\norm{q}_{\vec{Q}_0} \qquad \forall q\in Q_0.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  We say the pair $(\vec{V}_h,\vec{V}_0)$ satisfies the strong approximability condition if there exists a constant $C>0$ and an exponent $\gamma_2>0$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:weakApprox}
    \underset{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{K}_h}{\inf} \norm{\vec{u}-\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}} \leq C h^{\gamma_2}\norm{\vec{u}}_{\vec{V}_0} \qquad \forall \vec{u}\in \vec{V}_0.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Theorem 6.5.1 and Theorem 6.5.2 \cite{BBF}]
  The weak approximability condition on $(Q_h,Q_0)$ and the strong approximability condition on $(\vec{V}_h,\vec{V}_0)$ are necessary and sufficient for the convergence of $T_h$ to $T$ in the operator norm $\norm{\cdot}_{\mathcal{L}(\vec{H},\vec{H})}$.
  In particular, if both conditions are satisfied, then the following estimate holds:
  \begin{equation}
    \norm{T\vec{f}-T_h\vec{f}}_{\vec{H}}\leq \norm{T\vec{f}-T_h\vec{f}}_{\vec{V}}\leq C h^{\min\{\gamma_1,\gamma_2\}}\norm{\vec{f}}_{\vec{H}}, \qquad \forall \vec{f}\in \vec{H}.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
The previous theorem shows us that the discrete eigenvalues and eigenfunctions converge to the continuous ones without any spurious modes either if $T$ is considered as an operator from $\vec{H}$ to itself or as an operator from $\vec{V}$ to itself, more details can be found in \cite{Osborn, Boffi}.
The only thing left to do is to discuss how to determine the order of convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, since we have already established that the strong and weak approximability conditions are sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the convergence without spurious modes.

The most common approach to determine the order of convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is to use the one presented in \cite{MercierOsbornRappazRaviart}.
Unfortunately, this approach can not used if the $S_h$ operator is not uniquely defined, as is the case when the inf-sup condition is not satisfied.
\begin{lemma}
  
\end{lemma}

\section{Sufficient conditions for the strong approximability condition}
In this section, we will discuss two general criteria that guarantee the strong approximability condition.
We focus our attention on the strong approximability condition and not on the weak approximability condition because the weak approximability condition is a trivial consequence of the approximation properties of the finite element space $Q_h$.
In fact, following \cite{BBG} we observe that since $b(\vec{v}_h,q_h)$ vanish for all $\vec{v}_h\in \vec{K}_h$ and $q_h\in Q_h$ we can subtract from \eqref{eq:weakApprox} to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \underset{\vec{v}_h\in \mathbb{K}_h}{sup} \frac{b(\vec{v}_h, q)}{\norm{\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}}= \underset{\vec{v}_h\in \mathbb{K}_h}{sup} \frac{b(\vec{v}_h, q-q_h)}{\norm{\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}}\leq \norm{q-q_h}_{Q}.
\end{equation}
The previous inequality shows that the weak approximability condition is verified as long as any function of $Q_0$ can be ``well'' approximated by a function in $Q_h$.
The first criterion we will discuss is intimately related to the inf-sup condition and exactly divergence-free discretisation.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:strongApproxInfSup}
  Let us consider a discrete eigenvalue problem of the type of \eqref{eq:discreteStokes} and assume the following approximation properties hold:
  \begin{align}
    \forall q\in Q, \quad \exists q_h\in Q_h \text{ such that } \norm{q-q_h}_{Q}\leq C_1 h^{\gamma_1}\norm{q}_{Q_0},\\
    \forall \vec{u}\in \vec{V}, \quad \exists \vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h \text{ such that } \norm{\vec{u}-\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}\leq C_2 h^{\gamma_2}\norm{\vec{u}}_{\vec{V_0}},
  \end{align}
  for some $C_1,C_2>0$ and $\gamma_1,\gamma_2>0$.
  We denote the range of the discrete divergence operator as $\hat{Q}_h$, i.e.
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{Q}_h = \left\{q_h\in Q_h\,|\, \exists \vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h \text{ such that } \nabla\cdot \vec{v}_h=q_h\right\}.
  \end{equation}
  If the finite element pair $(\vec{V}_h,\hat{Q}_h)$ satisfies the inf-sup condition, with inf-sup constant $\beta>0$, then both the strong and weak approximability conditions are satisfied by the the finite element pair $(\vec{V}_h,Q_h)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We begin observing that if the inf-sup condition is satisfied by the pair $(\vec{V}_h,\hat{Q}_h)$, then the following estimate holds \cite[Proposition 5.1.3]{BBF}:
  \begin{equation}
    \underset{\vec{v}_h\in \hat{\vec{K}}_h}{\inf}\norm{\vec{v}-\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}\leq \underset{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h}{\inf}\norm{\vec{v}-\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}\leq C(\beta)h^{\gamma_2}\norm{\vec{v}}_{\vec{V}},\label{eq:strongApproxOptimalKernel}
  \end{equation}
  where $\hat{\vec{K}}_h\coloneqq \left\{\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h\,|\, b(\vec{v}_h,q_h)=0\, \forall q_h\in \hat{Q}_h\right\}$.
  Furthermore, we notice that $\hat{\vec{K}}_h\subset \vec{K}_h$, in fact if we pick $\vec{v}_h\in \hat{\vec{K}}_h$ and $q_h = \nabla\cdot \vec{v}_h$ then $b(\vec{v}_h,q_h)=0$ implies that the divergence of $\vec{v}_h$ vanishes almost everywhere, hence $\vec{v}_h\in \vec{K}_h$.
  Therefore from \eqref{eq:strongApproxOptimalKernel} we have that the strong approximability condition is satisfied and we know the weak approximability condition is trivially satisfied.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}[Scott--Vogelius]
  One of the classical examples of divergence-free discretisation, in two dimensions, is the Scott-Vogelius finite element pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^{k}(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^{k-1}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$, where $\mathcal{T}_h$ is a simplicial mesh of the domain $\Omega$.
  While the Scott-.Vogelius pair seems the most natural choice for the Stokes eigenvalue problem, it is well known that the inf-sup condition is not satisfied by all $k\geq 1$.
  In fact, it has been shown in \cite{GuzmanScott,ScottVogelius} that the inf-sup condition is satisfied by the Scott-Vogelius pair on all meshes only if $k\geq 4$ and we consider as pressure space the subspaces of $\mathcal{P}^{k-1}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)$ defined as
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{Q}_h = \left\{q_h\in \mathcal{P}^{k-1}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\,|\, \sum_{j=1}^{N(\vec{z})} (-1)^{N-j} q_h\big|_{T_j(\vec{z})}(\vec{z}) = 0 \quad \forall \vec{z}\in \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right\},
  \end{equation}
  where $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{T}_h)$ is the set of all singular vertices of the mesh $\mathcal{T}_h$ and $T_j$ are the $N(\vec{z})$ simplices of the mesh $\mathcal{T}_h$ belonging to the patch touching the singular vertex $\vec{z}$, i.e. vertices that are shared by two or more colinear edges. 
  Since the inf-sup condition is satisfied for $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^{k}(\mathcal{T}_h),\hat{Q}_h\right)$, we can apply Theorem \ref{thm:strongApproxInfSup} to conclude that the strong and weak approximability conditions are satisfied by the finite element pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^{k}(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^{k-1}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$.
  Hence, the Scott--Vogelius pair, with $k\geq 4$, is a good choice for the Stokes eigenvalue problem, independently of any geometrical restriction on the mesh.
  Furthermore, under minor assumptions on the mesh it has been proven in \cite{GuzmanScott2} that there exists a pressure space $\hat{Q}_h$ such that the inf-sup condition is satisfied for the Scott-Vogelius pair also with $k=3$, hence the strong approximability condition is satisfied for the finite element pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^{3}(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^{2}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$.
  Therefore the Scott--Vogelius pair with $k=3$ is a good choice for the Stokes eigenvalue problem, provided that the mesh satisfies the minor assumptions of \cite{GuzmanScott2} as we show in Example \ref{ex:ScottVogelius3}.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[Alfeld split meshes]
  In \cite{ArnoldQin, FuGuzmanNeilan} it is shown that for two-dimensional domain the inf-sup condition is satisfied by the pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^2(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^1_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ on special meshes known as Alfeld split meshes.
  Alfeld split meshes are a particular type of mesh where each triangle is split into three sub-triangles by connecting the vertices of the triangle with its barycenter.
  Interestingly, Alfeld splits remove any singular vertex from the mesh, hence the pressure space $\hat{Q}_h$ is the full space $\mathcal{P}^1_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)$.
  Since, on Alfeld splits, the inf-sup condition is satisfied for $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^2(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^1_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$, we can apply Theorem \ref{thm:strongApproxInfSup} to conclude that the strong and weak approximability conditions are satisfied for the finite element pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^2(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^2_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ and $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^2(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^2(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$.
  A numerical study of the above-mentioned finite element pairs on Alfeld split meshes will be presented in Example \ref{ex:Alfeld}.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
  In the previous example we didn't discuss the $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^2(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^1(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ finite element pair. In fact, while Theorem \ref{thm:strongApproxInfSup} would ensure both strong and weak approximability as for the other pairs in the previous example, the $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^2(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^1(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ is inf-sup stable on its own as proven in \cite{Boffi, HoodTaylor}.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}[Powell--Sabin]
  It has been shown in \cite{GuzmanLischkeNeilan, FabienGuzmanNeilanZytoon} that for two-dimensional domains the inf-sup condition is satisfied by the pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^1(\mathcal{T}_h),\hat{Q}_h\right)$, provided $\mathcal{T}_h$ is obtained via Powell-Sabin splits and the pressure space is defined as
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{Q}_h = \left\{q_h\in \mathcal{P}^{0}(\mathcal{T}_h)\,|\, \sum_{j=1}^{N(\vec{z})} (-1)^{N-j} q_h\big|_{T_j(\vec{z})}(\vec{z}) = 0 \quad \forall \vec{z}\in \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right\},
  \end{equation}
  Powell--Sabin split meshes are a particular type of mesh where each triangle is split into six sub-triangles by first performing an Alfeld split and then connecting the midpoint of the original triangles with the barycenter.
  Since, on Powell--Sabin splits, the inf-sup condition is satisfied for $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^1(\mathcal{T}_h),\hat{Q}_h\right)$, we can apply Theorem \ref{thm:strongApproxInfSup} to conclude that the strong and weak approximability conditions are satisfied for the finite element pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^1(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^1_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ and $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^1(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^1(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$.
  A numerical study of the above-mentioned finite element pairs on Powell--Sabin split meshes will be presented in Example \ref{ex:Powell-Sabin}.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Scott-Vogelius elements pair can be used also when the domain $\Omega$ is three-dimensional. In particular, it has been proven in \cite{Zhang} that on freudenthal meshes the Scott-Vogelius finite element pair is inf-sup stable for $k\geq 6$.
  Furthermore, it is well known in the literature that if suitable constraints are imposed on the pressure space then for $k\geq 2$ the Scott-Vogelius pair is inf-sup stable on Alfeld splits also for three-dimensional domains, and on Worsey--Farin splits the Scott-Vogelius pair is inf-sup stable for any $k\geq 1$, \cite{FuGuzmanNeilan, FabienGuzmanNeilanZytoon}.
  Applying Theorem \ref{thm:strongApproxInfSup} we can then prove that the finite element pairs $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^k(\mathcal{T}_h), \mathcal{P}^{k-1}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$, $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^k(\mathcal{T}_h), \mathbb{P}^{k}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ and $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^k(\mathcal{T}_h), \mathbb{P}^{k}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ all satisfy the weak and strong approximability condition for $k\geq 2$ on Alfeld splites meshes and for $k\geq1$ in Worsey--Farin splits.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
  As we discussed in many previous examples in order to obtain an inf-sup stable pair of finite elements from the classical Scott-Vogelius pair $\left(\vec{\mathcal{P}}^k(\mathcal{T}_h),\mathcal{P}^{k-1}_{disc}(\mathcal{T}_h)\right)$ we need to impose constraints on the pressure space at the singular vertices of the mesh.
  Interestingly enough many nearly singular vertices will cause more problems than an actually singular vertex. 
  In fact, a well-known phenomenon is that the inf-sup constant $\beta$ blows up as vertices in the mesh approach a singular vertex, hence even if the inf-sup condition is satisfied the Scott-Vogelius pair is not stable in practice.
\end{remark}
While we would expect the convergence rate of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to degenerate as the vertices of the mesh become singular, we will show in Example \ref{ex:singularity} that the rate of convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions remains optimal independently of the geometrical properties of the mesh.
Such observation suggests that Theorem \ref{thm:strongApproxInfSup} is not ``sharp'' with respect to the geometrical properties of the mesh, for this reason, we will now present a second criterion that guarantees the strong and weak approximability conditions and that is independent of the singularity of the vertices in the mesh.
Our approach is based on the way the approximation properties of divergence-free discrete functions are proven in \cite{AinsworthParker}.
In particular, we will make use of the curl operator that in two dimensions is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \nabla \times: \Sigma \to \vec{V} , \qquad \sigma\mapsto \begin{pmatrix} \partial_y \sigma & - \partial_x \sigma \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where as usual $\Sigma$ is the Sobolev space $H^2(\Omega)$, with appropriate boundary conditions.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:strongApproxCurl}
Let us consider a conforming finite element space $\Sigma_h$ of $\Sigma$, such that $\nabla\times:\Sigma_h\to \vec{V}_h$ is surjective and has a right-bounded inverse, with inverse norm $C_S$ independent of the mesh size $h$ and the singularity of the vertices of the mesh.
We now consider a discrete eigenvalue problem of the type of \eqref{eq:discreteStokes} and assume the following approximation properties hold:
\begin{align}
  \forall q\in Q, \quad \exists q_h\in Q_h \text{ such that } \norm{q-q_h}_{Q}\leq C_1 h^{\gamma_1}\norm{q}_{Q_0},\\
  \forall \sigma\in \Sigma, \quad \exists \tau_h\in \Sigma_h \text{ such that } \norm{\sigma-\tau_h}_{\Sigma}\leq C_2 h^{\gamma_2}\norm{\vec{u}}_{\vec{V}_0},\label{eq:approxSigma}
\end{align}
for some $C_1,C_2>0$ and $\gamma_1,\gamma_2>0$.
Under this assumption, the strong and weak approximability conditions are satisfied by the finite element pair $(\vec{V}_h,Q_h)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  As previously discussed the weak approximability condition follows trivially from the approximation properties of $Q_h$, hence we will focus our attention on the strong approximability condition.
  To prove the strong approximability condition we begin observing that since the operator $\nabla\times:\Sigma\to\vec{V}$  and $\nabla\times:\Sigma_h\to\vec{V}_h$ are both surjective, for all $\vec{u}\in \vec{V}_0$ and $\vec{v}_h\in \vec{V}_h$ there exists $\sigma\in \Sigma$ and $\tau_h\in \Sigma_h$ such that $\nabla\times \sigma = \vec{u}$ and $\nabla\times \tau_h = \vec{v}_h$.
  We then proceed using the fact that the curl has a right-bounded inverse to estimate $\norm{\vec{u}-\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}}$ as follows
  \begin{align}
\norm{\vec{u}-\vec{v}_h}_{\vec{V}} &= \norm{\nabla\times\sigma-\nabla\times\tau_h}_{\vec{V}}\leq C_S\norm{\sigma-\tau_h}_{\Sigma},
  \end{align}
  finally using the approximation properties of $\Sigma_h$ we obtain the desired estimate.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  We would like to point out that \eqref{eq:approxSigma} follows from the classical Bramble--Hilbert lemma.
